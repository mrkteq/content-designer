# Content Designer Portfolio

Three case studies demonstrating content design process, rationale, and execution.

## Technical Stack

1. **Capacity-Aware Content Design** — Productivity systems ignore variable cognitive capacity causing capacity-mismatched task execution.
2. **Format Adaptation for Different Use Cases** — Comprehensive methodologies unusable during active problem-solving due to cognitive load.
3. **Protocol and Guideline Design** — AI coding assistants accelerate productivity while simultaneously preventing comprehension and learning.
